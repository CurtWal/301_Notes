What is a ‘Controlled Component’?
- They are components in which form's data is handled by the component's state.


Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.
- It should be updated as soon as they enter them, it can be very annoying and an inconvenience if its a constant update.



How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?

- event.target.value

Why would we use a ternary operator?
- To specify that a certain block of code should be executed if a certain condition is met.


Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:

if(x===y){
  console.log(true);
} else {
  console.log(false);
}

- x === y ? console.log(true) : console.log(false)
